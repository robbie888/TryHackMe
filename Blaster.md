# Blaster Room

Date attempted 5th July 2021

This CTF is marked as an easy room. It doesn't tell use what target we're attempting to compromise.

My approach will be to use NMAP to discover open ports, looking for an attack vector and move forward from there.

### Tools

For this CTF I used the following tools:

Kali Linux
Nmap
Gobuster
Remmina (for RDP access)

## Recon

First I will start with NMAP, with basic scanning the target IP and looking for open ports.
