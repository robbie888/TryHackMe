# TryHackMe

My TryHackMe [profile](https://tryhackme.com/p/robbie888).

I started doing some of the training on TryHackMe to compliment my studies in Cyber Security.
So far I've found this site very useful it has a lot of great tutorials and interesting challenges.

To date I have completed **48 rooms** including training rooms and CTF rooms.

Here I am recording some of the CTF exercises I have been doing over the time. 
Doing these has taught me a lot and has been an enjoyable yet challenging experience.

## Paths

The first full path I completed was the Web Fundamentals path. I found this very interesting, it exposed me to a lot of tools and techniques that I'm certain will be useful in the near future :)

Here is the link to my full course write-up: [Web Fundamentals Path](https://github.com/robbie888/OWASP_Top10/tree/master/TryHackMe)
