I started doing some of the training on TryHackMe to compliment my studies in Cyber Security.
So far I've found this site very useful it has a lot of great tutorials and interesting challenges.

To date I have completed +20 rooms including training rooms and CTF rooms.

Here I am recording some of the CTF exercises I have been doing over the time. 
Doing these has taught me a lot and has been an enjoyable yet challenging experience.
